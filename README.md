# HighVibe

HighVibe is a high-frequency, unbiased enlightenment experience for web and mobile, powered by binaural beats and luminous minimalism.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Tone.js for real-time audio
- Framer Motion for subtle, breathing animations

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## App icon and favicon

Place your HighVibe logo as `public/icon.png`. That file is used as the favicon, PWA icon, and Apple touch icon. A square image (e.g. 512×512) works best.
